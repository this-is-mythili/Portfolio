About me

Hi, My name is Mythili. Since the beginning of 2023 I have been studying and practicing to become a QA. I am happy to have finally found an area in which i can successfully develop myself.I hope that in future i can become someone who professionally takes care of the quality of products and services. In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge of QA and showcase my practical skilss that have gained through courses and self-study. I am determined to continue to grow in this field. I have also done the course in test automation (selenium). so My main focus is on furthering my knowledge in this area.
